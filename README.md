[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/docassemble.ALDashboard.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/docassemble.ALDashboard)

A single tool and interview to centralize some tedious Docassemble admin configuration tasks.

1. Install the Document Assembly Line packages (support files for [Court Forms Online](https://courtformsonline.org))
1. Searchable user management - reset passwords and change privileges.
1. Installing or updating several packages at once.
1. Listing and viewing the contents of an (unencrypted) interview to facilitate debugging errors on production servers.
1. View analytics/stats captured with `store_variable_snapshot`.
1. List the files inside a particular package installed on the server.
1. Gather files from a user who left the organization/unknown username and password.
1. Review screen generator
1. validate DOCX Jinja2 templates
1. Generate a [custom bootstrap theme](https://suffolklitlab.org/docassemble-AssemblyLine-documentation/docs/customization/overview#creating-a-custom-theme-from-source-instead-of-with-a-theme-generator) for your interviews.

Ideas:
1. Add a link to the dispatch directive for an existing file in an existing package.
1. Generate translation files [TBD].

## Use

To use, you must create a docassemble API key and add it to your
configuration, like this:

`install packages api key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

If you want the ALDashboard to be a dropdown option for admins and developers, add the following to the configuration before your `install packages api key`: 

    administrative interviews:
      - interview: docassemble.ALDashboard:data/questions/menu.yml
        title: Dashboard
        required privileges:
          - admin
          - developer
