# Backend Configuration Tool

A single pane of glass that centralizes some tedious Docassemble admin configuration tasks:

Done: 

1. Installing or updating several packages at once
1. Listing and viewing the contents of an (unencrypted) interview to facilitate debugging errors on production servers
1. View analytics/stats captured with store_variable_snapshot


TODO:

1. List the files inside a particular package installed on the server
1. Add a link to the dispatch directive for an existing file in an existing package
1. Generating translation files [TBD]
1. Gather files from a user who left the organization/unknown username and password

To use, you must create a docassemble API key and add it to your
configuration, like this:

`install packages api key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
