  Mostly here to prevent docassemble from auto downloading bootstrap in the playground / on load
question: |
  Create a custom theme for Bootstrap
subquestion: |
  This interview will let you create a custom bootstrap theme, compiling it down into a single
  CSS file that you can include in your docassemble projects.

  For more information, see [our tutorial on making a custom bootstrap theme](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/theming-docassemble#creating-a-custom-theme-from-source-instead-of-with-a-theme-generator).
