  Mostly here to prevent docassemble from auto downloading bootstrap in the playground / on load
question: |
  Create a custom theme for Bootstrap
subquestion: |
  This interview will let you create a custom bootstrap theme, compiling it down into a single
  CSS file that you can include in your docassemble projects.

  For more information, see [our tutorial on making a custom bootstrap theme](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/theming-docassemble#creating-a-custom-theme-from-source-instead-of-with-a-theme-generator).

  You will need to have a recent version of Docassemble's "system" OS to use this tool. (at least 1.4.43). This may require
  an upgrade to the [Docker container](https://suffolklitlab.org/legal-tech-class/docs/practical-guide-docassemble/maintaining-docassemble#updates-to-the-docassemble-container).

question: |
  What file do you want to make a theme from?
subquestion: |
  It should include an `@import "bootstrap"` in it to actually include all of the bootstrap code.

  You can use [https://huemint.com/bootstrap-basic/](https://huemint.com/bootstrap-basic/)
  to generate the SCSS code.
fields:
  - How do you want to provide the file?: upload_choice
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Upload file: upload_file
      - Type it out here: type_out
  - SCSS file: uploaded_file
    datatype: file
    accept: |
      "text/x-sass,text/x-scss,.sass,.scss"
    show if:
      variable: upload_choice
      is: "upload_file"
  - note: |
      Type the contents of your bootstrap theme below
    show if:
      variable: upload_choice
      is: type_out
  - no label: file_text
    input type: area

    validation_error('You need to include the exact text \'@import "bootstrap";\' at the end of your SCSS block', field="file_text")

question: We weren't able to compile your SCSS

  Bootstrap returned this output when we tried to create your Bootstrap CSS file.

  ${ compile_output.stderr.decode() }

question: |
  Your file is compiled!
subquestion: |
  You can view and copy your file, or download it directly by right clicking the link to save it as a CSS file.

  ${ display_template(output_template, copy=True, collapse=True) }

  **[Bootstrap CSS file](${output_file.url_for(attachment=True)})**

  % if upload_choice == "type_out":
  **[:download: SCSS source file](${ output_scss.url_for(attachment=True) })**
  % else:
  **[:download: SCSS source file](${ uploaded_file.url_for(attachment=True) })**
  % endif

  Below are examples of all bootstrap components and what they will look like with this
  bootstrap theme.

  ${ test_html_file.slurp() }

script: |
  <script type="text/javascript">
    var link = document.createElement('link');
    link.setAttribute('rel', 'stylesheet');
    link.setAttribute('href', '${ output_file.url_for() }');
    document.head.appendChild(link);
  </script>
css: |
  <style>
    #daquestion {
      margin-left: 0% !important;
      width: 100% !important;
    }
    .bs-component + .bs-component {
      margin-top: 1rem;
    }
  </style>
